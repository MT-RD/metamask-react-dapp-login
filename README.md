# Web3 DApp in React & Login with MetaMask

A simple React/Web3 DApp that replicates a small portion of the Uniswap v2 interface - 
specifically, we build the "account login" button that allows users to connect to a DApp using their MetaMask extension.

## Objectives

* Working React app that will be able to connect to your MetaMask account
* Read your address & ETH balance
* If you connect with multiple accounts the interface will change to reflect the active account

## Package versions

* `react: ^17.0.2`
* `typescript: ^4.3.5`
* `@usedapp/core: ^0.4.4`
* `@chakra-ui/react: ^1.6.6`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Additional libraries 

* `@chakra-ui/react`
* `@emotion/react`
* `@emotion/styled`
* `@usedapp/core`
* `framer-motion`
