# Web3 DApp in React & Login with MetaMask

A simple React/Web3 DApp, using `Network.js` which can connect and 
request data from the Ethereum `mainnet` using `Infura` & `Metamask`

## Objectives

* [Infura](https://infura.io/) as a JSON-RPC connection to the mainnet or testnets;
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to serve as the user’s wallet and web3 provider;
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) for contracts and Network JS, a javascript library for web3 (i.e. blockchain development). 
This code tutorial is inspired by their dapp creation guide.


Using these products together has the benefit of replacing database setup and 
user credential management, resulting in a quick-to-start blockchain 
infrastructure. 

In this tutorial, we’ll create a React dapp using Network JS that can 
interact with MetaMask, which uses Infura as its connection to the Ethereum 
mainnet.

* `react: ^17.0.2`
* `typescript: ^4.3.5`
